    The result is a picture of size ``size``, whose color varies
    gradually from color `color_1` in position ``p1`` to color ``color_2``
    in position ``p2``.

    If it is a RGB picture the result must be transformed into
    a 'uint8' array to be displayed normally:

    Parameters
    ----------

    size : tuple or list
        Size (width, height) in pixels of the final image array.

    p1 : tuple or list
       Position for the first coordinate of the gradient in pixels (x, y).
       The color 'before' ``p1`` is ``color_1`` and it gradually changes in
       the direction of ``p2`` until it is ``color_2`` when it reaches ``p2``.

    p2 : tuple or list, optional
       Position for the second coordinate of the gradient in pixels (x, y).
        Coordinates (x, y)  of the limit point for ``color_1``
        and ``color_2``.

    vector : tuple or list, optional
        A vector (x, y) in pixels that can be provided instead of ``p2``.
        ``p2`` is then defined as (p1 + vector).

    color_1 : tuple or list, optional
        Starting color for the gradient. As default, black. Either floats
        between 0 and 1 (for gradients used in masks) or [R, G, B] arrays
        (for colored gradients).

    color_2 : tuple or list, optional
        Color for the second point in the gradient. As default, white. Either
        floats between 0 and 1 (for gradients used in masks) or [R, G, B]
        arrays (for colored gradients).

    shape : str, optional
        Shape of the gradient. Can be either ``"linear"``, ``"bilinear"`` or
        ``"circular"``. In a linear gradient the color varies in one direction,
        from point ``p1`` to point ``p2``. In a bilinear gradient it also
        varies symmetrically from ``p1`` in the other direction. In a circular
        gradient it goes from ``color_1`` to ``color_2`` in all directions.

    radius : float, optional
        If ``shape="radial"``, the radius of the gradient is defined with the
        parameter ``radius``, in pixels.

    offset : float, optional
        Real number between 0 and 1 indicating the fraction of the vector
        at which the gradient actually starts. For instance if ``offset``
        is 0.9 in a gradient going from p1 to p2, then the gradient will
        only occur near p2 (before that everything is of color ``color_1``)
        If the offset is 0.9 in a radial gradient, the gradient will
        occur in the region located between 90% and 100% of the radius,
        this creates a blurry disc of radius ``d(p1, p2)``.

    Returns
    -------

    image
        An Numpy array of dimensions (width, height, n_colors) of type float
        representing the image of the gradient.

    --------

        #[[1.  0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1]]

    """Make an image split in 2 colored regions.

    Returns an array of size ``size`` divided in two regions called 1 and
    2 in what follows, and which will have colors color_1 and color_2
    respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------

    x : int, optional
        If provided, the image is split horizontally in x, the left
        region being region 1.

    y : int, optional
        If provided, the image is split vertically in y, the top region
        being region 1.

    p1, p2: tuple or list, optional
        Positions (x1, y1), (x2, y2) in pixels, where the numbers can be
        floats. Region 1 is defined as the whole region on the left when
        going from ``p1`` to ``p2``.

    p1, vector: tuple or list, optional
        ``p1`` is (x1,y1) and vector (v1,v2), where the numbers can be
        floats. Region 1 is then the region on the left when starting
        in position ``p1`` and going in the direction given by ``vector``.

    gradient_width : float, optional
        If not zero, the split is not sharp, but gradual over a region of
        width ``gradient_width`` (in pixels). This is preferable in many
        situations (for instance for antialiasing).

    Examples
    --------

    .. code:: python

        size = [200, 200]

        # an image with all pixels with x<50 =0, the others =1
        color_split(size, x=50, color_1=0, color_2=1)

        color_split(size, x=50, color_1=[255, 0, 0], color_2=[0, 255, 0])
