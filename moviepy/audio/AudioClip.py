class AudioClip(Clip):
    """Base class for audio clips.

    See ``AudioFileClip`` and ``CompositeAudioClip`` for usable classes.

    An AudioClip is a Clip with a ``frame_function``  attribute of
    the form `` t -> [ f_t ]`` for mono sound and
    ``t-> [ f1_t, f2_t ]`` for stereo sound (the arrays are Numpy arrays).
    The `f_t` are floats between -1 and 1. These bounds can be
    trespassed without problems (the program will put the
    sound back into the bounds at conversion time, without much impact).

    Parameters
    ----------

    frame_function
      A function `t-> frame at time t`. The frame does not mean much
      for a sound, it is just a float. What 'makes' the sound are
      the variations of that float in the time.

    duration
      Duration of the clip (in seconds). Some clips are infinite, in
      this case their duration will be ``None``.

    nchannels
      Number of channels (one or two for mono or stereo).

    Examples
    --------

    .. code:: python

        # Plays the note A in mono (a sine wave of frequency 440 Hz)
        import numpy as np
        frame_function = lambda t: np.sin(440 * 2 * np.pi * t)
        clip = AudioClip(frame_function, duration=5, fps=44100)
        clip.preview()

        # Plays the note A in stereo (two sine waves of frequencies 440 and 880 Hz)
        frame_function = lambda t: np.array([
            np.sin(440 * 2 * np.pi * t),
            np.sin(880 * 2 * np.pi * t)

        Parameters
        ----------

        filename
          Name of the output file, as a string or a path-like object.

        fps
          Frames per second. If not set, it will try default to self.fps if
          already set, otherwise it will default to 44100.

        nbytes
          Sample width (set to 2 for 16-bit sound, 4 for 32-bit sound)

        buffersize
          The sound is not generated all at once, but rather made by bunches
          of frames (chunks). ``buffersize`` is the size of such a chunk.
          Try varying it if you meet audio problems (but you shouldn't
          have to). Default to 2000

        codec
          Which audio codec should be used. If None provided, the codec is
          determined based on the extension of the filename. Choose
          'pcm_s16le' for 16-bit wav and 'pcm_s32le' for 32-bit wav.

        bitrate
          Audio bitrate, given as a string like '50k', '500k', '3000k'.
          Will determine the size and quality of the output file.
          Note that it mainly an indicative goal, the bitrate won't
          necessarily be the this in the output file.

        ffmpeg_params
          Any additional parameters you would like to pass, as a list
          of terms, like ['-option1', 'value1', '-option2', 'value2']

        write_logfile
          If true, produces a detailed logfile named filename + '.log'
          when writing the file

        logger
          Either ``"bar"`` for progress bar or ``None`` or any Proglog logger.

        Parameters
        ----------

        fps
            Frame rate of the sound. 44100 gives top quality, but may cause
            problems if your computer is not fast enough and your clip is
            complicated. If the sound jumps during the preview, lower it
